Examples project for MDC verification:
-- src (RVC-CAL source files)
---- common (common actors between different application fields)
---- edgeDetection (edge detection applications: Sobel, Sobel X gradient, Sobel Y gradient, Roberts, Prewitt, Scharr)
---- filtering (HEVC motion compensation interpolation legacy (8 tap) and approximate (7, 5 and 3 tap) one-dimensional filters)
---- std (standard actors for sourcing and sinking)
------ stdio (source actor able to read single component binary inputs)
------ video (display actor able to display a YUV picture to video)
-- reference (reference I/O)
---- edgeDetection (reference output for the edge detection applications)
---- filtering (reference output for the filtering applications with MX=2 (parameter of coeff actor))
---- input (reference input image in different formats)

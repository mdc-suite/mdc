 * \mainpage Multi Dataflow Composer Tool
 * 
 * The <b>Multi Dataflow Composer</b> (MDC) is an automated dataflow-to-hardware framework,  developed by the 
 * <b>Microelectronics and Bioengineering Lab</b> (EOLAB) 
 * of the <b>Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</b> 
 * at the <b>University of Cagliari</b>.
 * 
 * Given a set on input dataflow, MDC generates a coarse-grain reconfigurable multi-dataflow, and the corresponding HDL.
 * 
 * The class in charge of initializing and launch MDC execution is: it.mdc.tool.core.MDCBackend()
 * 
 * 
 * @see For a general overview of the Multi Dataflow Composer Tool we refer the reader also to: http://sites.unica.it/rpct/

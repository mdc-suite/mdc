# MDC
Welcome to the main reposirory of the **Multi-Dataflow Composer (MDC)** design suite.

The _doc_ folder contains some useful documentation about **MDC**. In particular, the different features of the suite will be introduced separately below.

## Baseline
The baseline feature of MDC is...

## Profiler
The _profiler_ is..

## Power Manager
The _power manager_ is... 

## Prototyper
The _prototyper_ is in charge of generating a ready-to-use IP accelerator on the top of the CGR datapath provided by the _baseline_ feature.
Here below its main characteristics.
